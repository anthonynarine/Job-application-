# Job-application-
Job application  with django

URL Uniform Resource Locator. The address that the user enters in the
browser to REQUEST a particular resource.

1. project folder urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls), #auto generated by django.
    path("", hello),    #newly created path - a function must added for this new path
]

        The path("", hello) needs a function added in the project urls.py or in a seperate views.py convention is to create this file in the app folder. the corresponding function (view) should be created in the views.py file in the app folder as well. 

        *note the "" should have no space or the url will not load. 


2. create urls.py file in app folder. 
3. from django.urls import path
4. in views.py create the corresponding functon for the above url path. 

    ~note python knows to check this based on logic functionality in the settings.py
    file (see ROOT_URLCONF = "jobapp_project.urls")

5. from django.http import HttpResponse needs to be added to the views.py file.
6. the function must now be imported into our urls.py file
    from app.views import hello (ctrl space for a shortcut import)

7. in project urls.py file 
    add import include (from django.urls import path, include)
    update path("", include("app.urls"))

    URL's defined --> Views defined(function) --> logic within the function displayed

    User -> Django -> URL -> view -> template or model if model -> data
